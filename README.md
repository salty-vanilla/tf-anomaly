# tf-anomaly
Major anomaly detection methods using neural networks are implemented in this repository :fire:

## Environments
* python 3.6
* tensorflow 1.11

I use eager execution !!

## Implemented
* [Complementary GAN](https://github.com/salty-vanilla/tf-anomaly/tree/master/impl/complementary_gan)
* [DAGMM](https://github.com/salty-vanilla/tf-anomaly/tree/master/impl/dagmm)

## To Implement
* AnoGAN
* AVID
* Deep Anomaly Detection Using Geometric Transformations
* Efficient-GAN-Based Anomaly Detection
